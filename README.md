# Purl: Streamlining Text Processing

Purl is inspired by a knitting action and the sound of water. 'Purl' in knitting is doing the same thing over and over to make a pattern. The sound of a stream is also a steady flow. This tool, Purl, helps you change text easily, similar to Perl one-liners, but smoothly. It does tasks again and again inside, making working with text easy and smooth.
